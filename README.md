A gambling game inspired by stake.com.

– This project involves implementing physics elements: friction, gravity, sine, recoil, and collision physics within a canvas.
– The game mechanics include the speed of the ball changing after hitting obstacles, clock time management, and handling precision errors.
– Determinism is crucial in this gambling game to ensure fairness and consistent gameplay, preventing manipulation and creating a level playing field for all participants.
– The canvas API and physics concepts like velocity and collisions are utilized to create an engaging and realistic gaming experience.
– Writing physics code from scratch allows for more customization and control over the game’s behavior.
– The game loop, implemented using requestAnimationFrame, ensures smooth rendering and continuous updates, maintaining a consistent frame rate for optimal gameplay.
– Integrating a backend for probability calculations adds an additional layer of complexity, allowing for accurate determination of outcomes and multipliers.
– The ball class encapsulates the logic related to the ball’s movement and collisions, providing a modular and organized approach to the game’s development.
– Understanding the probabilities of winning and the casino’s advantage helps players make informed decisions and manage their expectations while participating in the Plinko game.
